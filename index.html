        Happy anniversary, Maya.
        I don't know how to wish you a Our first anniversary, 
        It may be cringy but I will just explain my memories, timi lai tha xa tai pani.

        From the first semester, I saw you and interacted with you. From that moment, I 
        started liking you. Day by day, I don't know how you feel and how you judged me, but
        I was so madly in love with you that I had countless sleepless nights. Just to see
        you, I used to go to college, and if we interacted that day, I felt so special, and
        that made my day. You dont know this ki timi lai text gare ra note magne bahana matra
        thiyo timro msg aaye paxi khai kina ho ramro lagthiyo.

        Also, kta horu le jiskauthiye tara ni malai testo kaile ni na ramro lagye na tini horu
        le nai garda yetiko bolna sakne vako jasto lauxa timro case ma. the teasing from our 
        friends made us mad, but rather they pushed us to be.There was a point where 
        I was in such a dilemma that if I adimit vane timi ma sanga kaile pani bolthinau.
        There was a time when we were not talking to each other, which made our relationship 
        stronger than ever. We were completely avoiding each other. Eak din, timi class bata 
        baira niskida ra ma class ma aauda dhoka ma timi lai akasai dekhda kasto heartbeat 
        bade ko thiyo. Yestai timi sanga na bolne reason le garda ni, I was waiting for my
        college days to be over

        But on October 9, 2023, that drunk text from you completely changed our lives. I 
        clearly remember Piyush uncle ra ma movie heri ra ko thiyam. Maile movie ko snap 
        khichna mobile nikale ko ta timro msg dekhya. When I opened it, it was a long text.
        Padna thalye ko ta process nai garna sake ra thiyena I was shaking and having
        butterflies. Ani Piyush lai room ma bolaye ani dekhaye timro msg; her ta smriti 
        ko msg aako raixa maile ta process nai garna saki ra ko xaina, and he explained
        the situation to me. I know that you were searching for a friend, but he made 
        me realize that I should take a chance.

        That day changed my whole life. Timi sanga bolne, basna, khaja khana jane,
        it felt good on different level I got you; you are not just my girlfriend; you
        areeverything to me. You bring me luck. Aile ko time ma aklai huda pani you
        are on my side No one has loved me like you do.
        
        I love everything about you: your crying, sleeping, irritation, anger, sadness,
        and all your moodswings. Khoi kina ho timi lai jiskauna jati ko majja kai 
        kura ma ni xain. Tara ghose risai halxe.

        Malai tha xa mummy baba lai fakauna garo xa vanne, but I will try my best.
        I may convince them that no one will love you as I do and that no one will 
        keep you happy as I do, despite your moodswings, because it is so difficult
        to predict.

        Sangai vaye ra first aniversary manaula vane ko... kai xaina nepala
        ayera manula

        From the journey from Bastola to your baby was the best thing that has ever 
        happened. There are more things ahead in our life, Aajai katti runa ra 
        fakaunai doll kindina vanna baki xa hola soche rai jhau lai sakyo tai pani
        these littel things make life exciting and I can't wait to experince with you.

        Happy anniversary, my love.
